## 📌 Research Questions & KPIs

1. **📉 Brands for Promotional or Pricing Adjustments**  
   → 198 brands show **low sales** but **high profit margins**. These are prime candidates for promotions or pricing changes to increase volume without sacrificing margin.

2. **🏆 Top Vendors by Sales & Purchases**  
   → Top 10 vendors contribute **65.69%** of total purchases. Remaining vendors contribute only **34.31%**, indicating a **vendor dependency risk**.

3. **📦 Impact of Bulk Purchasing on Cost Savings**  
   → Vendors buying in bulk receive up to **72% lower unit costs** (`$10.78/unit`) — bulk pricing strategies are highly effective in driving **cost-efficient growth**.

4. **🚨 Low Inventory Turnover Vendors**  
   → Total capital locked in **unsold inventory** is `$2.71M`. This affects **cash flow and profitability** — vendors with slow-moving inventory need better stock management.

5. **📈 Profit Margin Comparison: High vs. Low-Performing Vendors**  
   - **Top Vendors**:  
     - CI: (30.74%, 31.61%)  
     - Mean Margin: **31.17%**
   - **Low-Performing Vendors**:  
     - CI: (40.48%, 42.62%)  
     - Mean Margin: **41.55%**

   ➤ Low-performing vendors have **higher margins but lower sales**, suggesting **pricing inefficiencies** or **limited market reach**.

6. **📐 Statistical Validation of Profit Margin Differences**  
   - **Hypothesis**  
     - H₀: No significant difference in margins between vendor groups  
     - H₁: Significant difference exists  
   - ✅ **Result**: Null hypothesis rejected  
   - **Implication**: Two distinct profitability models are present.  
     - High-margin vendors: Could benefit from **better pricing strategies**  
     - High-sales vendors: Could focus on **operational efficiency**
